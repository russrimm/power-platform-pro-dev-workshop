### Authorize the PAC CLI

1. Run the following command at the new terminal in your Code Space:

   ```bash
   pac auth create --deviceCode
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you see an error then close any existing terminals and open a new one using ```Ctrl+Shift+` ```

1. Copy the https://microsoft.com/devicelogin link and paste it into the **browser profile window that you created earlier**. 

1. Copy the code, and paste it into the **Enter code** prompt and select **Next**.  

1. Select the Workshop User account that is Signed In. If you do not see it, then select **Use another account**, type in your workshop username and password, and click **Sign in**.

> [!NOTE]

9. If you see a **Pick an account** screen, select your workshop user which should say *Signed In* next to it.

9. You will then see a page asking if you're trying to sign in to Power Platform CLI - pac.  

9. Click **Continue**
   You'll then see a prompt confirming that you have successfully signed in to Power Platform CLI - pac. Close the browser tab and return to your codespace.  

9. The Code space terminal should show the message **Authentication profile created** showing the workshop user you were provided.  

9. At the terminal type `pac auth list`. You will see the new auth profile with an asterisk (*) next to it indicating that it is the currently selected profile. The profiles is created as **UNIVERSAL** meaning that it is not specific to any specific environment.  

9. To select our developer environment, expand the Power Platform left panel. If you do not see the **UNIVERSAL** profile, hover over the AUTH PROFILES area and select **Refresh**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you do not see the power platform extension logo as in the screenshot below, press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, and then type `Developer: Reload Window` and press `ENTER`.

9. If you now run `pac auth list` you will see the URL of the environment you have selected listed. The asterisk (*) indicates that this is the currently selected auth profiles if you have multiple different profiles for different tenants. You can switch using `pac auth select --index`  

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also select an environment by using
   > `pac org select --envrionment <URL/ID/Unique Name/Partial Name>`

9. To ensure that you are connected to the correct environment, at the terminal type `pac org who`
   This will show the current connection and environment selected.  

### ðŸ‘‰Import workshop solution and data

This workshop uses a solution as a starting point. We can import the solution and the sample data using the PAC (Power Platform CLI)

1. Inside VS Code, at the PowerShell terminal use:
   ```
   pac solution import --path "C:\WorkshopStarterSolution\PowerPlatformProDeveloperWorkshop_1_0_0_0.zip"  --async  --publish-changes
   ```

   Wait for the solution to import and publish.

1. Import the reference and sample data using:

```powershell
pac data import -d "C:\WorkshopStarterSolution\reference-data.zip"
pac data import -d "C:\WorkshopStarterSolution\sample-data.zip"
```
